# HOW TO USE
This tool is a very simple tool to use.  
 
Before starting: Every time after you drag and drop something you will have to press enter. 
 
You will be asked if you want to also parse the mapents. You will have to write “Yes” or “No” depending on what you want to do. If you type “Yes” you will be able to drag and drop the mapents file. If you type “No” you will automatically skip this part. 
 
After this you will be asked to drag and drop the .map file. Just drag and drop it and the parser will start parsing. 
 
After parsing any file the output will be a “.json” file and there will be a list of models exported, it would be called “filename_xmodelslist.txt”
